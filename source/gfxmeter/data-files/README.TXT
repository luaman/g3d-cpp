GFX-Meter

Run gfxmeter to evaluate your card.  There are three axes on which cards are graded:

Features:
 More features are better!  GeforceFX and Radeon X series cards should achieve a "f60" level, which corresponds roughly to DirectX PS 2.0/VS 2.0.  Older cards will fall below this.

Speed:
 Faster is better!  The arbitrary scale is set so that 2005 cards will achieve about 50.  The 2006 cards should go beyond 100 on this scale.  Speed takes into account both your graphics card and processor.  On laptops, run with AC power for higher numbers.

Quality:
 Graphics drivers are terribly buggy.  The quality setting measures how many known bugs are present in the driver that you are using.  The quality setting is biased towards NVIDIA (who has better OpenGL drivers at this moment) and counts very few bugs.  Future releases of this benchmark will increase the number of bugs detected.

DISCLAIMER:
This is an arbitrary benchmark.  I wrote it to help grade the performance of graphics cards relative to my own 3D library.  Use 3DMark or another established benchmark to determine the overall ability of your graphics card.  I used hardware donated by NVIDIA and ATI to develop this benchmark.


Some stats for reference:

AMD 1.7 GHz     GeForce 6800            f60 /  50.0 / A+
P4  1.4 GHz        Radeon X800            f60 / 20.5  / B+
Celeron 500 MHz Mobility Radeon 9000  f35 /   9.6  / A-
