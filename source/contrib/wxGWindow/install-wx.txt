INTRO ----- 

The installation instructions for wxWidgets are confusing. This
diretory contains code and instructions for using G3D in the same
application as wxWidgets 2.5.3, on Windows platforms only. These
instructions don't cover wxWidgets/G3D interoperability on other
platforms, although the process should be similar on those platforms.

For Windows users, we have provided precompiled binaries, but you can
also compile wxWidgets yourself. 

Note: There is at least one newer development release of wxWidgets (2.5.4) 
since version 2.5.3. These instructions have been created with 2.5.3. 


USING PRECOMPILED BINARIES
-------------------------

To configure wxWidgets correctly for use with G3D, you can download 
precompiled Windows binaries: 

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/g3d-cpp/wxWidgets-2.5.3-win32.zip?download

Add the include and library directories to your build setup: in 
C++, Tools menu -> Options -> Projects -> C++ -> Directories.


COMPILING wxWidgets YOURSELF
----------------------------

1) Download wxWidgts 2.5.3 for windows:
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.5.3-setup.zip

2) Run installation and put it somewhere.  I put mine at C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3

3) Open C:\wxWidgets-2.5.3\build\msw\wx.dsw into MSVC6 (NOT wxWindows.dsw!)

4) In solution wx, project gl, "Setup Headers" folder, edit the setup.h file. It starts out saying
       #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       0
Change this to: 
       #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1

5) Select "Batch Build" from the Build menu.

6) Check the "build" checkbox for the targets that end in only 
" - Win32 Release" or " - Win32 Debug". That is, you DO NOT need or want to 
build any target that is a DLL, or uses Unicode or Universal. Just the vanilla
static libraries. 
   
   Press "Build".  It should take about 15 minutes to compile wxWidgets.

7) Add the include path, by going to Tools menu -> Options -> Projects -> VC++ -> Directories. Select "Include files" from "Show Directories for..", then add: 
   C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\include    C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\lib\vc_lib\msw

8) Select "Library files", and add:
   C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\lib\vc_lib

COMPILING THE DEMO PROJECT
---------------------------

1) Create a project and add cpp/source/contrib/wxGWindow/demo.cpp wxGWindow.cpp
wxGWindow.h to it.

2) Add resource.rc to the project.
