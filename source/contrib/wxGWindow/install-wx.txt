The installation instructions for wxWidgets 2.5.3 are confusing.  To configure
wxWidgets correctly for use with G3D, either download the precompiled Windows
binaries we have made from:

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/g3d-cpp/wxWidgets-2.5.3-win32.zip?download


Or follow this process:

1) Download wxWidgts 2.5.3 for windows:
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.5.3-setup.zip

2) Run installation and put it somewhere.  I put mine at C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3

3) Open C:\wxWidgets-2.5.3\build\msw\wx.dsw into MSVC6 (NOT wxWindows.dsw!)

4) Edit the setup.h file under Headers/Setup folder under wxWindows to use:

       #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1

5) Select "Batch Build" from the Build menu.

6) Check all targets that end in only " - Win32 Release" or " - Win32 Debug".  
   That is, you DO NOT want to build any target that is a DLL or uses Unicode.
   Press "Build".  It should take about 15 minutes to compile wxWidgets.

7) Add to your INCLUDE directories:
   C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\include    C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\lib\vc_lib\msw

8) Add to your LIBRARY directory:
   C:\libraries\wxWidgets-2.5.3\lib\vc_lib


To compile the demo project:

1) Create a project and add cpp/source/contrib/wxGWindow/demo.cpp wxGWindow.cpp
wxGWindow.h to it.

2) Add resource.rc to the project.
