   <LI>Microsft Visual C++ 6.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0 (which comes as part of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002 and 2003) 
	require different versions of the library, and a few different installation steps. Precompiled binaries for MSVC 6 are located
	in win32-lib and precompiled binaries for MSVC 7 are in win32-lib7. Figure out which one you're using, and point to the right
	G3D binaries, or you will have strange trouble, including linker errors and memory leaks.

   <LI>Make sure that SDL <B>version 1.2.7</B> is installed on your machine. 
   Try running <CODE>sdl-config --version</CODE>. If it returns "1.2.7" then you're all set. 
   (<CODE>sdl-config</CODE> is a handy tool that tells you what flags to pass to your compiler
   and linker to use SDL. If you run into SDL trouble, <CODE>sdl-config</CODE> is your friend.)
   If <CODE>sdl-config</CODE> can't be found, or returns something other than "1.2.7", you'll 
   need to install or update SDL. Download and install SDL from
   <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">http://www.libsdl.org</A>. 
   </LI>

   <LI>We recommend using <A HREF="http://ice.sf.net">iCompile</A>, 
	which automatically compiles and links every C++ file in the directory it's run from, 
	so you won't need to edit it to refer to each source file (as you would with a Makefile). 
	It needs the following environment variables, which you can set in your .cshrc file using 
	setenv. If you're using iCompile,
	you will need to set up some environment variables to point to SDL and %G3D. 
	Modify the paths as appropriate for your installation:

	<CODE>
	INCLUDE ~me/libraries/g3d/include:/usr/include/SDL <BR>
	LIBRARY ~me/libraries/g3d/linux-lib<BR>
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LIBRARY <BR>
	CC gcc-3.2 <BR>
	CXX g++-3.2 <BR>
	</CODE>

	You are also welcome to use a makefile; set compiler and linker flags to point to SDL and %G3D.   
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Confirm that you've installed %G3D correctly by installing and running one of the demos:<BR>
	<CODE>cd g3d/demos/GLG3D_Demo</CODE><BR>
	<CODE>icompile --run</CODE><BR>
	This should run the GLG3D demo; you should see many colored airplanesflying around a pink and blue sky.

  @section build Building G3D

  You don't have to build %G3D to use %G3D; the instructions above walk you through 
  setting up your environment to use the precompiled %G3D binaries. You may <EM>want</em>
  to build %G3D in order to: 
  <UL>
  <LI>Step into library functions while debugging
  </LI>
  <LI>Use an unsupported compiler
  </LI>
  <LI>Customize the library code.
  </LI>
  </UL>
<P>
<I>We recommend using Xcode 2.1 or 2.2 to build G3D, and then using the same version of Xcode to build your G3D programs, both using Xcode project files included in the source distribution, and from the command line. Here, we first give instructions to get prerequisites required to build either way, then directions to build with Xcode, then include the instructions for a more traditional, unix/command-line style build.</I>

   \section defines #defines
    G3D pays attention to the following #defines.
   <P>
     <B>SSE</B> - Allows the use of Intel PIII SSE instructions for faster math
      routines.  On Win32, you will need the Visual Studio processor pack 
      (Free from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/ppack/default.asp)
      to build with this option.  Your code will only run on PIII or later
      machines.  <B>If you have the student edition of MSVC</B>, you must
      remove the #define SSE line from platform.h in order to build or you will get errors like <CODE>vector3.inl(24) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file:
   'xmmintrin.h': No such file or directory</CODE>


    <P>
	 <B>_MSC_VER</B> - Use Microsoft x86 assembly when assembly code is needed.

    <P>
     <B>NO_SDL_MAIN</B> - Do not attempt to link against sdlmain.lib.

    <P>
     <B>_DEBUG</B> - Build in debug mode and link against the debug runtime DLLs.  This enables debugAssert, 
     debugBreak, debugAssertM, array bounds checks, etc. (Can be overriden by G3D_DEBUGRELEASE)
     <P>
     <B>G3D_DEBUG</B> - Enable debugAssert, 
     debugBreak, debugAssertM, array bounds checks, but relies on the _DEBUG flag to indicate whether
     to compile in debug or release mode.(Can be overriden by G3D_DEBUGRELEASE)
   <P>
   <B>G3D_DEBUGRELEASE</B> (or G3D_RELEASEDEBUG)- Use the release build of G3D and the standard library, but keep assertions
   that check for user errors.  This mode allows your program to run fast but still be debuggable.
    <P>
     <B>G3D_DEBUG_NOGUI</B> - When building in debug mode, this flag
      says to use stdout and not popups on Windows for assertion 
      failures and error messages.  On Linux the console is always used.

      <P>
      <B>G3D_GL_ARB_multitexture_static</B> - Assume OpenGL 1.3 when compiling the G3D library (specifically for Linux).  Must be configured when the library is built.
    <P>
      <B>G3D_WINSOCK_MAJOR_VERSION</B> - Controls the Winsock version used on Win32.  Must be configured when the library is built.
      <p>
      <B>G3D_WINSOCK_MINOR_VERSION</B> - Controls the Winsock version used on Win32.  Must be configured when the library is built.
    <P>
     <B>_WIN32</B> - Build using Windows API calls 

   <P>
     The static libraries themselves are built <I>without</I> SSE.  The 
     -debug versions have _DEBUG, the regular versions do not.
   
     <P>

     <B>G3D \#defines</B> one of the following based on the platform:
     <B>G3D_WIN32, G3D_MINGW32, G3D_LINUX, G3D_OSX</B>
