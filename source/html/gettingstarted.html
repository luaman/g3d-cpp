<H1>Getting Started with G3D</H1>
<A HREF="index.html">&lt;&lt; Documentation Main Page</A>
<P>

This document describes how to create a 3D application using G3D on <A
HREF="#Win32">Windows</A>, <A HREF="#Linux">Linux</A>, and <A
HREF="#OSX">OS X</A>.  G3D programs are platform independent-- if you
write strictly to G3D and not a platform API, you should be able to
recompile and run on a different platform.
<P>

These instructions assume you want to use both the G3D geometry
library and the GLG3D OpenGL wrapper classes.  If you prefer to use
raw OpenGL, DirectX, or a platform graphics API you should write your
own <CODE>main.cpp</CODE> in the style of <A
HREF="../demos/Win32_Demo/main.cpp">demos/Win32_Demo</A>.

<P>

See the <A HREF="index.html#Installation">G3D Installation
Instructions</A> for information on downloading and installing G3D and
its dependencies.

<OL>
  <LI>Make a new Win32 Application Project.

  <LI>Copy <CODE>SDL.dll</CODE> and <CODE>zlib1.dll</CODE> to your
  directory (they are needed at runtime).

  <LI>Copy either <CODE><A HREF="../demos/main.cpp">demos/main.cpp</A></CODE>
    or <CODE><A HREF="../demos/main-no-GApp.cpp">demos/main-no-GApp.cpp</A></CODE> to your directory.

  <LI>Add that copy of <CODE>main.cpp</CODE> to your project.
 
</OL>

The <CODE>#include &lt;G3DAll.h&gt;</CODE> file contains
<CODE>#pragma</CODE> statements that automatically configure the
correct linker and compiler settings for your project.  Just press F5
to compile and run.

  <LI>Install <A HREF="http://ice.sf.net">iCompile</A> on your system.

  <LI>Copy either <CODE><A HREF="../demos/main.cpp">demos/main.cpp</A></CODE>
    or <CODE><A HREF="../demos/main-no-GApp.cpp">demos/main-no-GApp.cpp</A></CODE> to your directory.

  <LI>Set your <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> and <CODE>LIBRARY</CODE> paths to
  contain the SDL and G3D directories if you have not done so previously.

</OL>

iCompile automatically detects and links G3D and SDL to your project.
Unlike a Makefile, it requires no configuration.  Just run "icompile --run".

Building applications G3D on OS X has only been tested on OS X 10.3
(Panther) using Xcode.



<OL>

<LI> Make sure that the SDL framework is installed. Use the version
of SDL from http://www.libsdl.org. 

<P>

<LI> Start Xcode 

<P>

<LI> Start a new project by selecting the menu item
    File/New Project

<P>

<LI> Select Cocoa Project 

<P>

<LI> Selecting a new Cocoa Project automatically generates
    main.m and a precompiled header (whose name depends 
    on your project name, but it always ends in .pch).
    If you want to use a precompiled header, you can 
    place any includes in this .pch file, but you
    should probably remove Cocoa.h.

<P>

<LI> Add SDLMain.m and SDLMain.h to your project.  you absolutely need
    these. Use the Project/Add Files menu for this.

<P>

<LI> Add the OpenGL and SDL frameworks to your project.  Use the
    Project/Add Frameworks menu for this.

<P>

<LI>Add the following libraries to your project libGLG3D.a, libG3D.a,
    libjpeg.a to your project.  I often have to use the Finder to drag
    and drop these files into my project.  I also typically put them
    in the "Frameworks" section, before OpenGL.framework or
    SDL.framework.
  
<P>

<LI>Disable the ZeroLink flag in the Xcode settings for this project.
    ZeroLink is an Xcode feature that allows for faster startup when
    debugging or running a program from the Xcode IDE, but this
    feature is not compatible with SDL.

<P>

<LI>Add the Zlib library to the project.  This can be done by 
    adding '-lz' to "Other Linker Flags" in the project settings. 

    To get to this setting, select the top-level icon in the left pane
    of your Xcode project.  For example, if your project is called
    "MyApp", there will be a blue Xcode with the label "MyApp" in the
    "Groups and Files" pane of your Xcode project.  Select this icon,
    and then select the menu item "Project/Get Info" (or use the key
    equivalent Command-I). Select the "Styles" tab for the project
    info.  Under the "Common Settings" pane, there is a setting called
    "Other Linker Flags".  Add -lz to "Other Linker Flags" on all
    build Styles.  Usually there is a build style for Development and
    one for Deployment.

<P>

<LI>You'll have to add the appropriate header paths 
    to your Xcode project so the compiler can find the
    G3D header files.

<P>

<LI>Copy either <CODE><A
    HREF="../demos/main.cpp">demos/main.cpp</A></CODE> or <CODE><A
    HREF="../demos/main-no-GApp.cpp">demos/main-no-GApp.cpp</A></CODE>
    to your project. 

</OL>

Caveats for G3D on OS X:

<UL>

<LI> There is a version of SDL available through Fink, the popular
    open-source package manager for OS X.  We have no idea if the fink
    version of SDL for OS X will work with G3D.  This document assumes
    that you're using the SDL library for OS X that is downloaded from
    www.libsdl.org or one of its mirrors.  We suspect that the version
    of SDL for OS X available from fink uses X11, which is wholly
    different from the windowing and rendering system that G3D for OS
    X assumes.

<P>

<LI>
    You can also use the command line tool 'xcodebuild' to build the G3D
    libraries from the Xcode project files, but without using the Xcode
    IDE.
