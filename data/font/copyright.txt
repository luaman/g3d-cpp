You may freely use and distribute the G3D .fnt files in
commercial and non-commercial projects.

These .fnt files contain compressed images of characters.  
While the original true-type fonts have copyrights owned
by their respective owners, my understanding is that
images of characters produced with those fonts are not
copyrighted by the font owner (otherwise you could never
use a font to produce a document).  Therefore the copyright
on the .fnt file data is not owned by the font creator.
The fonts themselves were downloaded from freeware font
sources on the internet and the default Windows fonts.
Attribution for fonts is listed in the Change Log.
