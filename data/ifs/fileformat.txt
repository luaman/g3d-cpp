The little-endian IFS (indexed face set) file format is:

file := 
  fileheader +
  vertexheader +
  vertex* +
  triheader +
  tri*

fileheader   := (string32) "IFS" + (float32)1.0 + (string32)modelname
vertexheader := (string32) "VERTICES" + (uint32)numVertices
vertex       := (float32)x + (float32)y + (float32)z
triheader    := (string32)"TRIANGLES" + (uint32)numFaces
tri          := (uint32)v0 + (uint32)v1 + (uint32)v2

Where string32 is an unsigned 32-bit integer length (which includes null terminator) followed by a string of that many unsigned char's.  The strings above all include null termination.

Vertex indices are zero based.

Triangles have counter-clockwise winding direction in a right handed coordinate system.  Triangles are "one sided".

Models "face" along the negative z-direction.  For example, the P51 Mustang
should fly along its object space -z axis.
